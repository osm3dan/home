<p>I participated in <strong>VSJ (Volcanological Society of Japan) Fall Meeting</strong> for the first time! I talked in an online oral session about parts of my latest reserch titled “<strong>Volcanic earthquakes generating unusual tsunamis near Torishima Island: Observational evidence of trapdoor faulting at submarine calderas</strong>”. I appreciate to all the audiences who gave me with valuable feedbacks!</p>
