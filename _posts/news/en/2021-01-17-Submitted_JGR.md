#### **Submitted a new manuscript to JGR-Solid Earth.**

I submitted a first-authored manuscript to Journal of Geophysical Research - Solid Earth.
The co-authors are Drs. Hiroo Kanamori, Luis Rivera, Zhongwen Zhan, Shingo Watada, Tung-Cheng Ho, and Kenji Satake.
You can check the detailed information in "[Works](https://osm3dan.github.io/en/publications)". 

The submitted manuscript is available in a pre-print service [Earth and Space Science Open Archive (ESSOAr)](https://www.essoar.org/doi/10.1002/essoar.10505947.1). Please note that the manuscript is not peer-reviewed.
