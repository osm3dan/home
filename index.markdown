## **Welcome to Osamu Sandanbata's website!**

I am **Osamu Sandanbata**, an Earth scientist from/in Japan. My interests are in various geophysical phenomena near the Earth surface. Currently, I am studying **physical mechanisms of large earthquakes with seismic magnitudes >5 at volcanic calderas**. To understand the complex processes, I use data analysis and numerical modeling of tsunamis, crustal defromation, and seismic waves.
